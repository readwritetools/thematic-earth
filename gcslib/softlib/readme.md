	<tr><td>The <span class=product>softlib</span> JavaScript library has functions for type expectations, soft assertions, and logging to the terminal with stack trace.</td></tr>
</table>

### Motivation

Before typescript came on the scene this library was a good way to reliably
verify that function inputs were in their expected form. It continues to be an
essential library for software written in pure ECMAScript.

### Features

The `expect` function provides runtime type safety without the overhead of a
precompiler. It provides a strong measure of safety during execution by
providing an early warning system when things aren't proceeding as expected.

The `aver` function is a soft assertion. When conditions should be true, an `aver()`
can alert the developer that things haven't lived up to their promise. This is
done in a non-fatal way, allowing the condition to persist (even when the aver
fails) letting the code deal with the condition using whatever coding paradigm
is in force, such as a try/finally block or other exception/error handling
techniques.

The `terminal` function provides context sensitive logging. When reached via a
browser, output is routed to the console as a warn() or error(). When reached
via a node.js process, output is routed to stdout or stderr.

The `vartype` function provides dynamic introspection of a variable's current
type. It goes beyond ECMAScript's native `typeof` and `instanceof` keywords by
inspecting the name of the variable's constructor.

The `StackTrace` class provides a stack trace for the other functions.

### Installation

The <span>softlib</span> library may be installed directly from github or via
NPM.

To add the library to a node.js project, use this command:

```bash
[user@host]# npm install softlib

import {expect} from 'softlib';    
import {aver} from 'softlib';    
import {terminal} from 'softlib';    
import {vartype} from 'softlib';    
```

To add the library to a browser project, use this command:

```bash
[user@host]# git clone https://github.com/readwritetools/softlib.git

import {expect} from '/softlib/expect.js';    
import {aver} from '/softlib/aver.js';    
import {terminal} from '/softlib/terminal.js';    
import {vartype} from '/softlib/vartype.js';    
```
