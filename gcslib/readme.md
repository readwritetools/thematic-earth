	<tr><th>Abstract</th></tr>
	<tr><td>The <span class=product>gcslib</span> JavaScript library is for parsing and serializing Geographic Coordinate System encoded strings and buffers. It serves as a GIS exchange format for points, lines, and polygons that use longitude/latitude coordinates.</td></tr>
</table>

### Motivation

The creation of this library and CLI was motivated by the desire to create GIS
shape files that can be downloaded by website visitors in a highly compressed
format.

### Summary

The `gcslib` package is a core JavaScript library used by the Geoplex package, the
GCSIO command line tool, and the Thematic Earth web component.

Supported input and output formats comprise:

   * geojson - RFC 7946
   * gfe - Geographic Feature Encoding
   * ice - Indexed Coordinate Encoding
   * tae - Topological Arc Encoding
   * gfebin - Geographic Feature Encoding binary
   * icebin - Indexed Coordinate Encoding binary
   * taebin - Topological Arc Encoding binary

The JavaScript API reads from and writes to standard ECMAScript Strings and
ArrayBuffers.

The API does not access the host computer's file system, so it can be used with
client facing web pages that obtain data using HTTP.

See also: The GCSIO CLI tool which uses the node.js filesystem package to read
and write files using the API's exported functions.

### Installation

The <span>gcslib</span> library may be installed directly from github or via
NPM.

#### Browser

To install and use the API

```bash
[user@host]# git clone https://github.com/readwritetools/gcslib.git
```

Sample web frontend to fetch and parse an ICE file into memory:

```javascript
import API from 'node_modules/gcslib/api/user-api.js'
import GcsHoldingArea from 'node_modules/gcslib/gcs/gcs-holding-area.class.js'
    
var response = await fetch("https://example.com/my-dataset.ice");
var payload = await response.text();

var gcsHoldingArea = new GcsHoldingArea();
var options = {
    inputFormat: "ice",
    datasetId: "myDataset",
    properties: "all"
};

if (API.parseIce(gcsHoldingArea, payload, options) == true) {
    // gcsHoldingArea now contains the parsed features with their geometries and properties.
}
```
